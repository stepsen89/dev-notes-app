// what are different types of javascript?

// primitive: boolean, number, string, null, undefined
// non primitive: object

// typeof returns the typeof

// dynamically typed
the type of var a = 'foo' will be infered
// A language is dynamically-typed if the type of a variable is checked during run-time

// static typed like JAVA you have to specify what type each variable will hold
String a = 'moo'

// advantages of dynamically typed languages

// advantages of statical typed languages

// if JavaScrtipt doesn't know the type of a variable it will be initialised with undefined

// it is used to inform you that it is either an unitialised value, a parameter that is missing from the
// parameters list or it is perhabs an unknown property
// null can set the value of a variable to null, JavaScript engine will never do that for you
// in Java it is the concept of an absent value

// type of null will return object but this is a mistake of the JavaScript engine known for years now

// null == undefined will return true (the value)
